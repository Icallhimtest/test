Organise your tournament !

singles
later:
    doubles
    multi-categories
    pools
    Tête de séries

Use res.partners for participants
custom tree view (maybe inheritance from kanban ?), handle search -> update avg start time
list view by start time 

to set up : tournament (-> categories) -> type (#sets), need avg match time, number of fields, participants, ranking

match states : draft, confirmed, playing, done, cancelled - handle bye/walkover

more to come.
