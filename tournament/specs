Organise your tournament !

singles
later:
    doubles
    multi-categories
    pools
    Tête de séries

Use res.partners for participants
custom tree view (maybe inheritance from kanban ?), handle search -> update avg start time
list view by start time 

to set up : tournament (-> categories) -> type (#sets), need avg match time, number of fields, participants, ranking

match states : draft, confirmed, playing, done, cancelled - handle bye/walkover

more to come.

To do: get the models right, upcoming matches, define (binary?) tree view



To do list:

do the pretty kanban tree view
do a usable editable treeview to launch matches (score field with pencil to next point) tree view sorts by start date / round
pretty editor for score from both views (kanban records need a "set score" button) do the auto-fill thing with points_per_set if first score is deterministic (care, allow invalid scores for abandons)
make template tournaments per sport
Handle the start time generation
Englobe tournaments into other models to have multiple disciplines (singles, doubles, etc) And generate dates for this
